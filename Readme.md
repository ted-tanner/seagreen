# SeaGreen Threading Library

## TODO

* All __cgn_threadl accesses should be made safe for multithreading
* Need to synchronize adding/removing threads, or linked-list may become disjointed
* All double-underscore functions and typedefs can be moved to a "private" header
* Don't need to remove a block. If it was needed at some point of the program, it will likely be needed again.
